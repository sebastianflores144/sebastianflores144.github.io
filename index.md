### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, Part 1 was a favorite due to its simplicity and enjoyable nature. I liked using vectors to take command line arguments. It was also intriguing to discover the non-intuitive nature of indexing.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was an enjoyable experience using count-controlled for loops to create patterns. It provided intriguing visualization of loop functionality and enhanced understanding of infinite loop causes in programs.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was my absolute favorite due to the exciting opportunity to work with graphics. Creating a gradient gif using 2D vectors and loops was incredibly enjoyable. Moreover, this lab showcased the rewarding nature of coding.
