### CPSC 120

* [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-05-sebastian-courtney/tree/main/part-1)

    Lab 5, Part 1 was one of my favorite labs due to its simplicity and enjoyable nature. I liked using vectors to take command line arguments. It was also intriguing to discover the non-intuitive nature of indexing. Also this lab gave some amusing results which made this lab fun and rewarding.

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-08-sebastian-and-james/tree/main/part-1)

    Lab 8, part 1 was an enjoyable experience using count-controlled for loops to create patterns. It provided intriguing visualization of how count-controlled for loops work. This lab also helped me understand what causes infinite loops in programs and how to prevent them.

* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-12-kenneth-sebastian/tree/main/part-1)

    Lab 12, part 1 was my absolute favorite due to the exciting opportunity to work with graphics. Creating a gradient gif using 2D vectors and loops was incredibly enjoyable. I also thought this lab displays just how much you can do with a very simple graphics API. Moreover, this lab showcased the rewarding nature of coding.
